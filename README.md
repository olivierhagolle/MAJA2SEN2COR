# MAJA2SEN2COR
Converter of MACCS/MAJA format to Sen2Cor format. It is able to convert either from MACCS/MAJA native format, also used in Sen2Agri project, or from the data format of  the L2A products generated by MACCS / MAJA within Theia. 

A user manual file is provided in this repository (TechnicalNote_MaccsMuscate2Sen2cor.docx).

The command syntax is very simple. 
```
python MaccsMuscate2Sen2cor.py -p ../MaccsMuscate2Sen2cor/demo/MACCS_20170410 -w /tmp [-r FRE/SRE]
```
-p is the input product, which type  (Native/Theia) is automatically recognized

-w is the output directory

-r is optionnal and allows to choose between SRE (Surface reflectance without terrain correction) and FRE (Flat reflectance (with terrain correction). By default, FRE is used.


Currently the tool does not provide the metadata file for Sen2Cor.
